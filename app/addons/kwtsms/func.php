 * FILE:      app/addons/kwtsms/func.php
 * CREATED:   2026-10-20 19:53 +03
 * TASK:      596
 * AUTHOR:    kwtSMS
 * WHAT:      Procedural functions of the kwtSMS add-on: the install and uninstall handlers named in
 *            addon.xml and the renderer of the visible "info" setting.
 * WHY:       addon.xml cannot express a random value (cron_key) or the HTML of the settings info item.
 *            Services and hooks arrive in later tasks; this file stays free of business logic.
 *            2026-10-20 20:46 +03: reworded when the table sweep was removed from fn_kwtsms_uninstall()
 *            (addon.xml names every table), task 596.
 * USAGE:     Loaded by CS-Cart: fn_kwtsms_install() and fn_kwtsms_uninstall() by the add-on installer,
 *            fn_kwtsms_settings_info() by Admin > Add-ons > kwtSMS (settings page).
 * DEPENDS:   CS-Cart 4.18.1 to 4.21.2 core (Tygh\Settings, fn_url, fn_html_escape).
